# PodChaos: single graph-writer pod in a failure state for 10 minutes.
# Use pod-failure (not pod-kill) so the pod isn't replaced immediately. Observations: results/WORKER_V3_CHAOS_README.md.
#
# Apply:  kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/chaos-mesh/chaos/podchaos-graph-writer-failure-10m.yaml
# Remove: kubectl delete -f deploy/kubernetes/chaos-mesh/chaos/podchaos-graph-writer-failure-10m.yaml
# (Removing early ends the failure and restores the pod before 10m.)
#
# For 5 minutes instead, set duration: "300s" and use a copy of this file or edit in place.
